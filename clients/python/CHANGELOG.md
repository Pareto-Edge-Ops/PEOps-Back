# Changelog

## 0.2.0 — 2026-06-11

- **Local serving**: `LocalRunner.from_deployment()` pulls the deployed,
  Astra-compressed artifact (sha256/ETag-cached on disk) and serves it with
  onnxruntime on your own hardware (`pip install 'astra-ai-sdk[serve]'`).
- **Run a local file**: `LocalRunner.from_file("model.onnx")` serves an artifact
  you already have (e.g. the SDK Hub "Download Artifact" file) — no deployment
  needed; telemetry off unless you pass `deployment_id` + `api_key`.
- **Built-in telemetry**: every local inference is measured (latency
  breakdown, batch, input signature) and shipped in fault-tolerant background
  batches to the Astra dashboard — plus periodic system snapshots (CPU/RSS/
  throughput/runtime fingerprint) and windowed input/output distribution
  stats that power prediction/input drift alerts. Opt out with
  `report_telemetry=False` or `ASTRA_SDK_TELEMETRY=0`.
- **No base URL in your code**: `base_url` is optional everywhere — it defaults
  to the hosted Astra origin (override with `ASTRA_BASE_URL` or the `base_url`
  keyword). `from_deployment(deployment_id, api_key)` and
  `AstraClient(deployment_id, api_key)` need only the deployment id + API key.
- **CLI**: `astra pull | serve | bench` (`--base-url` is optional).
- Retries with exponential backoff on transient HTTP failures; telemetry can
  never raise into your serving path (drop-oldest queue, atexit flush).
- PEP 561 (`py.typed`), MIT license, full PyPI metadata.

## 0.1.0

- Initial release: `AstraClient.infer()` against the hosted
  `POST /api/v1/infer/{deployment_id}` endpoint.
